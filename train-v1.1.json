Configure Tenable Adapter You must create a Tenable adapter for Cisco ISE to communicate with Tenable SecurityCenter (Nessus scanner) and obtain the VA results. Before You Begin Note\t You must configure the following in Tenable SecurityCenter before you can configure the Tenable Adapter in Cisco ISE. Refer to Tenable SecurityCenter Documentation for these configurations. You must have Tenable Security Center and Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner installed. While registering the Tenable Nessus scanner, ensure that you choose Managed by SecurityCenter in the Registration field. Create a user account with Security Manager privilege in Tenable SecurityCenter. Create a repository in SecurityCenter (Log in to Tenable SecurityCenter with Admin credentials and choose Repository > Add). Add the endpoint IP range to be scanned in the repository. Add Nessus scanner. Create scan zones and assign IP addresses to the scan zones and scanners that are mapped to these scan zones. Create a scan policy for ISE. Add an active scan and associate it with the ISE scan policy. Configure settings, targets (IP/DNS names). Export System and Root certificates from Tenable SecurityCenter and import it in to the Trusted Certificates store in Cisco ISE (Administration > Certificates > Certificate Management > Trusted Certificates > Import).

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target.

A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component.
